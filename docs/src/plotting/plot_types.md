# Types of plots
Currently, there are three implemented plotting types. They are `spectra`, `transient` and `structure_3d` which are wrappers for `Plotly`'s  `go.Scatter()` and `go.Scatter3d` respectively. Where `transient` is specifically used for plotting lifetime data on a log scale. 

Details of each plot type can be found here:
