# Transient plots
The figures plotted using the `transient` plot type have been shown extensively in the section on [fitting](../fitting/fitting.md#fitting-experimental-data-to-energy-transfer-models) however it is worth discussing the purpose and limitations of this plot type.

The goal of this plot type is to quickly plot transients on an appropriate log scale for easy interpretation. It does, however, have its limitations - It may not correctly display this data, if so you may have to look at setting custom `x,y` axis limits. It then plots ~3 orders of magnitude on the `y-axis` and the `x-axis` limits are set from zero to the maximum value of your data. The `x-axis` label default is milliseconds; however, as was the case for the spectra plot, this can be easily [reconfigured](configuration.md) to an appropriate time base.

The `transient` plot type is designed to handle either `x,y` data as might be returned from the fitting process, for example, or it can take a `Trace`. This was to minimise code/data duplication. If you have defined a `Trace` for your data and given it a name, you can pass this in directly without having to worry about providing any `y` values.
